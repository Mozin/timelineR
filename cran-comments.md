## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. 

* Fixed bugs: Updated the code to work for newer versions of R

I am submitting this version being an old and original maintainer for the CRAN package https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/timelineR/index.html

This package was initially developed by the team at Vimana Inc https://govimana.com/ when I was working there. As the company has moved to a new direction, none of the authors are able to access the email ids submitted in CRAN. I being the original maintainer and seeing the good response from the community for the package and after having discussed it with the old team have decided to fork and maintain the package for the open source community. The new source for the package is : https://github.com/Mozin/timelineR. I have also updated the email id of the authors who worked on it with their permissions. I request you to restore the package on CRAN with the new github source

## Test environments
* local OS X(12.0) install, R 4.2.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTES.

## Reverse dependencies
No reverse dependencies.
